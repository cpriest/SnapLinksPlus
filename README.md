* 2018-02-28 - **Beta** Release v3.1.2b1 &nbsp; [![Firefox Beta][FF16]][MozBeta] &nbsp; [![Chrome][CH16]][ChromeRelease]
* New Website Online: [Snap Links 3](http://cpriest.github.io/SnapLinksPlus/)

&nbsp;
## Background on Snap Links 3

Snap Links Plus is being re-written from the ground up to be a [Web Extension](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions).

This means some legacy features may no longer exist while other new features are written.

The reasons behind this are simple, [electrolysis](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Electrolysis) is here, [XUL/XPCOM are on the way out and chrome style plugins are the new standard](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2015/08/21/the-future-of-developing-firefox-add-ons/), which also happens to be both restartless and compatible with chrome, opera and other browsers.
