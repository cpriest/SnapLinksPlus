## Need Help

I'm happy to review pull requests, but I'm not able to spend much time on the project, any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated. I'm also willing to help you with your local development environment if you need help.

I'm looking for some people to help triage [new issues](https://github.com/cpriest/SnapLinksPlus/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) and label them appropriately, answer them if they are feature related, confirm them if they are bugs.  It would be a **huge help** to the project.  I had time recently to work on the project and found myself spending time going through tickets instead.

If you're interested, please reach out to me by opening a ticket about it.

Thanks!
